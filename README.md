How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)

Graceful degradation and service workers first focus on function over form, which means we focus on features first. For example, with graceful degradation in terms of WebDev, we ensure our features are working and how they implement and interact with the program. With service workers, we ensured that data can be cached and deals with network requests, which the user won't really see first hand.
